# EditableClock
An editable clock made in C for one of my classes called "Digital circuits and microcontrollers". My partner and I, programed the micro known as "atmega328p". The outputs we used were an lcd (to show the time and date) and a keypad (to realize changes).
Here is a screenshot of the componentes and conexions in proteus
